							preview what's in store.</p>
					</div>
				</div>

				<p>
					When you interact with a given document on the Carbon server, you can specify a model that
					governs how the server behaves with respect to it. A document in Carbon can be treated as an LDP
					Container and an LDP RDF Source, or in some cases, an LDP Non-RDF Source (such as a binary file).
					When you want the server to treat a given document as one type or
					another, you can specify which model you prefer with an HTTP header in the client request.
				</p>

				<p>The preferred interaction model is specified by the HTTP <code>Prefer</code> header, which must have one of
					the following values:</p>

				<ul>
					<li><code>http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#Container; rel=interaction-model</code></li>
					<li><code>http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#RDFSource; rel=interaction-model</code></li>
					<li><code>http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#NonRDFSource; rel=interaction-model</code></li>
				</ul>


				<h2>Container Behavior</h2>

				<p>When you want the server to treat a document as an LDP Container, use the following interaction model in your
					request:
				</p>

				<p>
					<span class="ui blue horizontal label">HTTP Prefer</span>
					<code>http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#Container; rel=interaction-model</code>
				</p>

				<p>As the name implies, LDP Containers contain things. Well, they don't literally contain things in the same way
					that folders might, but the concept is similar. A container is itself an RDF Source with triples that link to a
					set
					of one or more members. So, when you want the server to behave in a way that helps you manage members in a
					collection, you'll want to make requests that specify the LDP Container interaction model.
				</p>

				<div class="ui message">
					<p>When a server is behaving with the Container interaction model, it can respond to client requests for
						creation,
						modification, and/or enumeration of its members.</p>
				</div>

				<p>A Container is also an LDP RDF Source, so while it has a special function as a membership controller, it may also
					represent additional data that is valuable to the clients that access it. In other words, in addition to having
					membership and/or containment triples, it can still have a variety of triples or properties that are specific to
					the resource it represents.
				</p>


				<h2>LDP RDF Source Behavior</h2>

				<p>When you want the server to treat a document as an LDP RDF Source, use the following interaction model in your
					request:</p>

				<p>
					<span class="ui blue horizontal label">HTTP Prefer</span>
					<code>http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#RDFSource; rel=interaction-model</code>
				</p>

				<p>An LDP RDF Source is an RDF graph or the <em>source</em> of one or more arbitrary triples that share the same
					subject URI. When we use the LDP RDF Source model for a document, we're generally referring to the document as
					the resource it represents - some real world resource, for example. You typically prefer this model when your
					working only with the document itself, or properties of the document.</p>

				<div class="ui message">
					<p>When a server is behaving with the RDF Source interaction model, it applies no special features for managing
						members or non-RDF &quot;files&quot;. Use the RDF Source model when you're interested only in the document
						itself - reading the triples or properties it contains, updating or deleting them, and adding new ones. You
						can
						also use the model to create a document with a given URI that will not be contained by any given Container
						(i.e. to create an <em>access point</em>).
					</p>
				</div>


				<h2>LDP NonRDF Source Behavior</h2>

				<p>An LDP Non-RDF Source is a resource whose state is not represented in RDF. For example, these can be binary or
					text documents that do not have useful RDF representations (i.e. &quot;files&quot;). When dealing with a Non-RDF
					Source, Carbon may still manage metadata about the resource using server-managed properties. You might also want
					to
					manage your own metadata about the resource, which you could do using the RDF Source interaction model on the
					same
					URI. But the context of the non-RDF interaction model is the non-RDF resource itself.

				<div class="ui message">
					<p>When a server is behaving with the Non-RDF Source interaction model, it treats the given resource as a
						non-RDF
						&quot;file&quot;.</p>
