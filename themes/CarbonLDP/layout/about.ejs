            <h1>About Carbon LDP</h1>

            <p>Carbon is a server that responds to RESTful HTTP requests for reading and writing data. Acting as an
                authentication server, a database, and a security manager, it provides most of the server-side components
                developers need to build robust, data-centric web apps using pure client-side code. As such, it reduces
                the need to design, develop, deploy, and configure server-side components such as an application server,
                a database, and custom server-side code.
            </p>

            <div class="ui huge message message--about">
                <p>Carbon makes it easier and faster for <em>every-day</em> web developers to build apps that process and manage data rather than just content.</p>
            </div>


            <h2>Why Carbon?</h2>
            <p>Like many popular NoSQL document-oriented databases, Carbon provides the ability to read and write
                <em>data documents</em> using simple JavaScript objects or JSON. Carbon data, however, is stored in a
                graph database, which is more advantageous than common document-oriented and traditional relational
                databases in a variety of cases. Since the data is stored natively in RDF (the Resource Description Framework),
                <strong>Carbon makes it easy to model any kind of resources without the need for rigid schemas.</strong> Need a new class,
                instance, property, or relationship? Simply add it on-the-fly. Forget about primary and foreign key
                relationships. Applications powered by Carbon are inherently <em>semantic</em> - capable of linking data
                with other applications and across the World Wide Web.</p>

                        <h3>Carbon LDP turns data graphs into documents so that working with data is like working with web pages - simple.</h3>
                        <p>Much like web pages, clients can retrieve a Carbon document by URL. However, most web pages are semi-structured and
                        designed to be rendered in a web browser for human consumption. Carbon resources are represented by fully
                        structured data. This makes them both easily transformed into HTML for rendering in a browser and more
                        easily understood and processed by machines. This leads to a host of computational benefits and integration
                        capabilities not afforded by typical application architectures. Applications powered by Carbon are ready
                        for the next Web.

                        <h3>Carbon provides fine-grained access to the data that exists within and across multiple documents.</h3>
                         <p>Each document acts as an end-point that can be queried using the powerful SPARQL semantic query language. To query
                        across all data in a Carbon app, you can execute a query on the root document. Or, you can limit a query by
                        executing it on any given point in a document hierarchy. SPARQL provides a full set of analytic query operations
                        as well as a graph traversal syntax for graph-centric operations.</p>

                        <h3>Carbon LDP includes a Workbench - a graphical user interface that helps you visualize and manage data outside
                            of your custom application. </h3>
                        <p>The Workbench provides a convenient way to create and list applications. It also
                            features a Document Explorer for visualizing the documents, data, and links that exist in an application.
                            It features a SPARQL Client so that you can compose queries and inspect data outside of your client-side
                            application code. It also provides a utility for exporting and importing data backups. The Workbench itself
                            is open-source. Developed as a Carbon app using Angular 2, it provides example code that developers can use
                            as an example for how to build rich, single-page applications using popular front-end frameworks and Carbon LDP.
