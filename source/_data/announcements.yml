      This year, we’re taking Carbon LDP to NG-Conf, the World’s Original Angular Conference,
      in Salt Lake City, UT (April 5th-7th). Come to learn about Carbon LDP, a back-end to your Angular App,
      and how you can build data-centric apps using the power of linked data.
      If you’re planning to attend, we hope you’ll find us at stand #24, or you can get a glimpse of the
      action on the conference Livestream or at one of the many NG-Conf Extended events taking part across the globe.
      Join us and see how Carbon LDP could be the hottest new addition to your Angular application stack.
