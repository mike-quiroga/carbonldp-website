<!-- START: Install Docker-->
<section class="mainContent-section">
	<h2>Install Docker</h2>
	<hr>
	<p>The Carbon Platform and Workbench are packaged in <a href="https://www.docker.com/what-container" target="_blank">Docker containers</a>, which ensure the software will always run the same,
		regardless of its environment (Mac, Windows, or Linux). Docker allows you to spin up a Carbon platform (server) and
		a workbench (GUI), with just a single command for each.</p>
	<p>To get started, you will first need to install Docker on your computer. Download the binaries and get
		basic installation instructions for Docker here:</p>
	<p><a href="https://www.docker.com/products/overview#/install_the_platform">https://www.docker.com/products/overview#/install_the_platform</a></p>
	<p>After installing Docker, execute the following command to validate that it was correctly installed and is running in your machine.</p>


	<pre><code class="bash">
    docker run hello-world
    </code></pre>

	<p>If all went well, you should see a message similar to the following in your terminal.</p>


	<pre><code class="bash">
        Hello from Docker!
        This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.
    </code></pre>
</section>
<!-- END: Install Docker-->


<!-- START: Configure the Carbon platform-->
<section class="mainContent-section">
	<h2>Configure and run the Carbon platform</h2>
	<hr>
	<p>
		Carbon LDP runs as a server that listens for, and responds to RESTful HTTP requests for managing resources. This is the essential platform, which provides an authentication
		server, a database and security management. It's where all the data of your application will be stored and managed.
	</p>


	<!-- START: Register for updates -->
	<section class="ui message mainContent-subSection">
		<h3 class="header">Register for updates and community support</h3>
		<p>
			You should register before running an instance of the platform.<br>
			Registration allows us to notify you with important information such as when new features or bug fixes are released. It is also a suggested prerequisite for getting better community support through GitHub issue tracking; we prioritize our
			registered users first.<br>What's more, registration qualifies you to receive Valued Feedback Rewards for providing useful feedback
			<br>If you haven't already
			registered, please <a class="item" href="/get-started">Get Started</a>. After filling out a very brief form, you'll be returned to this guide.

	<!-- START: STEP 1 -->
	<section class="transition mainContent-subSection">
		<h3>1. Create the platform's home directory</h3>
		<p>
			In a folder on your machine, create a directory named:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>carbonldp</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			This is the directory in which the platform will store all your data.
			<br>
			If you want to configure your platform ports, credentials, etc. rather than using the default values, you can do so by following the steps listed below:

		<h3>2. Run a platform instance</h3>
		<p>
			Run the following command to start your own platform instance for the first time. The command will fetch the image from a Docker repository and will install and run
			the Carbon Platform.
		</p>

		<p>
			<strong>Note:</strong> You must replace <code>/your/directory/path/carbonldp</code> with the absolute path to the <code>carbonldp</code> directory you just created. Leave the portions after the colon near the path
			intact (<code>:/opt/carbonldp/shared</code>)
		</p>
		<pre><code class="bash">
            docker run -d --name carbonldp-platform -p 8083:8083 \

        </code></pre>
		<p>
			After executing the command, open <code>localhost:8083/.system/platform/</code>. If the server is running successfully you should see a response in XML similar to the
			following:
		</p>
		<p><img class="ui bordered image" src="/assets/images/carbon-platform-api-response.png"/></p>
		<p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
		<ul>
			<li>What you'll actually see in the browser may depend on the configuration you created and the browser you are using.</li>
			<li>It may take a while for carbon to start. Keep refreshing the page. If after 5 minutes, the XML response still doesn't display, something went wrong.</li>
			<li>If you can't load the page, check the URL. It MUST end with a slash /. All URLs handled by the platform will follow this rule.</li>

<!-- START: Run the Workbench -->
<section class="mainContent-section">
	<h2>Run the Carbon workbench</h2>
	<hr>
	<p>The Carbon workbench is a web app that helps you interact with the Carbon platform through a graphical user interface (GUI). Among the features it provides are</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Document Explorer - a GUI for visualizing and editing Carbon documents</li>
		<li>SPARQL Client - a GUI for entering and executing SPARQL queries and SPARQL updates with results displayed in a friendly format</li>
		<li>Security Management - a GUI for managing your users and roles</li>
		<li>Backup Management - a GUI for creating backups of your information</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Using the Carbon Workbench will aid your development process, especially in the beginning, because it allows you to quickly have a visual verification of the data you create
		using either the JavaScript SDK or REST API.<br>It also provides an easy way to query, inspect and modify data with the SPARQL Client.</p>

	<p>To run the Carbon workbench, execute the following command (replacing the configured host, port, and protocol where appropriate).</p>

	<!-- @formatter:off -->
    <pre><code class="bash">
        docker run -d --name carbonldp-workbench -p 8000:80 \
            -e &quot;CARBON_HOST=localhost:8083&quot; \
            -e &quot;CARBON_PROTOCOL=http&quot; \
            carbonldp/carbonldp-workbench
    </code></pre>


    <p>After executing the command, open <code>localhost:8000</code> in your web browser. If the workbench is running, you should be presented with a login page like this:</p>

    <p><img class="ui centered bordered image" src="/assets/images/workbench-login-prompt.jpg"/></p>

    <p><strong>Note:</strong> It may take a while for the workbench to start. Keep refreshing the page. If, after 5 minutes, the page still doesn't load, something went wrong.</p>

</section>
<!-- END: Run the Workbench -->


<!-- START: Create a user -->
<section class="mainContent-section" id="create-a-user">
    <h2>Create a user</h2>
	<hr>
    <p>
	    At this point, you can login to the Workbench using the <code>platform.system-user</code> credentials you used when creating the <code>config.yaml</code> file. Generally, however, you
	    will want to reserve that User for special administrative operations only. The Platform System User <strong>isn't restricted by security</strong>. It can do anything inside of your
	    instance - <strong>even destroy it</strong>. That's why it is not recommended to use it for normal actions (think of it like the root user on a Linux machine, which you shouldn't
        use for day-to-day work). Following are the steps required to create a new User that you can use for day-to-day work:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Navigate to <code>http://localhost:8000/login</code> in your web browser.</li>
        <li>Click the hyperlink where it says, &quot;Don't have an account? Create one&quot;.</li>
        <li>Enter name, e-mail address, password, and profile ID and then click "Register".</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You should now be able to login with the e-mail address and password you used to register your new user.</p>
</section>
<!-- END: Create a user -->


<!-- START: Develop with the JavaScript SDK and REST API -->
<section class="mainContent-section">
    <h2>Develop with the JavaScript SDK, REST API, and optional tools</h2>
	<hr>

    <!-- TODO: Change this instructions to a more generic list of how to use the platform (through the REST API, for example) -->
    <p>Of course, the platform instance you just created is just the space in which Carbon will store the data for the application you now need to build. The next step is
        to use the JavaScript SDK with your client-side code to build a client application. Head over to
        <a class="item" href="/documentation/javascript-sdk/getting-started">Getting Started with the JavaScript SDK</a> to learn how.</p>

    <p>Note: If you are running your own local instance of the platform, you'll likely need to turn off https in the SDK. To do that configure the following setting
        when creating your Carbon object (you'll understand what this means after reading the JavaScript SDK Getting Started guide):</p>

    <pre><code class="actionscript">
        let carbon = new Carbon( &quot;your-domain&quot;, false );
    </code></pre>

    <p>You should also bookmark the <a href="https://carbonldp.github.io/carbonldp-js-sdk">Carbon LDP JavaScript SDK API Reference</a> on GitHub, which lists
        all the API objects and methods you can use.</p>

    <section class="mainContent-subSection">

    </p>

	<p>To update the platform and workbench you need to follow the steps below:</p>

	<ol class="ui list">
		<li>
			<p>Pull the remote newest images again by running the following commands:</p>
			<!-- @formatter:off -->
