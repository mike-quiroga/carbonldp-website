					<h2>Object Model</h2>

					<p>The following diagram depicts the all of the objects you can manage and interact with using REST. All objects are RDF resources. You can think of them as RDF <em>documents
					</em> which, once created, are identified by a URI. You can create, update, read, and delete these objects by issuing HTTP requests to the URI of the resource or its
						parent container (e.g. POST, PUT, GET, DELETE). There are also other types of RESTful operations that each object might expose depending on the type of the object. The
						object hierarchy depicts how certain objects extend others and thus would have the same RESTful operations or behavior as the parent type.

					<h2>Object Descriptions</h2>

					<p>Following is a brief description for each of the objects, listed in alphabetical order.</p>

					<div class="ui vertical segment">
						<h4>AccessPoint</h4>
						<p>An AccessPoint is a class of container that can manage member resources stored in another
							container other than itself. Both DirectContainer and IndirectContainer are of this class. However, since the IndirectContainer is not yet implemented in Carbon, the
							AccessPoint can be regarded as equivalent to DirectContainer.</p>

						<p>An AccessPoint is useful when you want to manage more than one list of members for more than one given property on a resource. To understand how this is useful, consider
							the BasicContainer in contrast.</p>

						<p>A BasicContainer stores its members in itself, but is limited to managing only one list of members by one single property (e.g. <code>ex:hasChildren</code>).
							If you need multiple membership properties on a container, each managing a kind of membership to the resource (and where the members may not exist within the container
							itself), the AccessPoint can help. Imagine a BlogPost resource, for example. With an AccessPoint, you could define properties like <code>ex:comment</code>,
							<code>ex:tag</code>, <code>ex:like</code> all on the same BlogPost resource with each property managing one or more members. The comments or tag resources may
							be stored in child comments and tags containers, but they are managed and enumerated by the parent BlogPost container.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="ui vertical segment">
						<h4>AccessControlList</h4>
						<p>A configuration resource that defines the security access control for a given resource. An AccessControlList controls access
							to a resource by defining what permissions one or more given roles have on the resource.</p>
						<p>The ACL defines an <code>accessControlEntry</code> and an <code>inheritableEntry</code> - each linking to an
							<code>AccessControlEntry</code> by way of a blank nodes. The entry linked by <code>accessControlEntry</code>
							defines access to the resource itself. The entry linked by <code>inheritableEntry</code> defines permissions that can be
							inherited by child resources when the child resources do not override them.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="ui vertical segment">
						<h4>Agent</h4>
						<p>An RDFSource document that represents a user or system account that can authenticate with the Carbon platform or a
							Carbon application.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="ui vertical segment">
						<h4>Application</h4>
						<p>An RDSource document that represents an application in the Carbon platform. In order to create a new Carbon application, you
							must post an Application RDFSource document. Doing so creates the root container for your new application, under which you
							can begin posting application-specific resources.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="ui vertical segment">
						<h4>AppRole</h4>
						<p>An RDFSource document that is used to control access to application resources. An AppRole defines what kind of access a group of agents have on one or more resources.</p>
						<p>An AppRole is defined by the <code>rdf:type</code> of <code>https://carbonldp.com/ns/v1/security#AppRole</code> (or <code>cs:AppRole</code>, for short).</p>
					</div>
					<div class="ui vertical segment">
						<h4>Backup</h4>
						<p>An RDFRepresentation that describes the zip archive created by an ExportBackup job; it contains information such as the archive's format, size, and cretaion time, for
							example.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="ui vertical segment">
						<h4>BasicContainer</h4>
						<p>An LDP Container whose members are stored within itself.</p>
						<p>In a BasicContainer, the property <code>ldp:contains</code> defines a set of triples, maintained by the container, which are documents created by the container.
							In LDP terminology, these are called &quot;containment triples&quot; and they always bear the triple form of:</p>

						<p><code>&lt;Container URI&gt; &lt;ldp:contains&gt; &lt;Document URI&gt;</code></p>

						<p>Basic Containers provide the most straight-forward way to have generic storage in Carbon and for creating a containment hierarchy of arbitrary resources.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="ui vertical segment">
						<h4>Container</h4>
						<p>As the name implies, LDP Containers <em>contains</em> things. They don’t actually literally contain resources, but rather – they contain links pointing to other
							resources. Basically, they represent collections. A container responds to client requests for creation, modification, and/or enumeration of its linked members.
							In other words, the URI that identifies a given container acts as an HTTP interaction point through which members and membership can be managed.</p>
						<p>A container is also an RDFSource, so while it has a special function as a membership controller, it may also represent additional data that is valuable to the clients that
							access it. In other words, you can interact with a Container as both a membership controller and as an RDFSource document. The behavior depends upon the interaction
							model defined as part of your request.</p>
						<p>There are three different types of LDP containers, each with variant uses and capabilities, and described by one of the three container types with <code>rdf:type</code> of
							<code>ldp:BasicContainer</code>, <code>ldp:DirectContainer</code>, or <code>ldp:IndirectContainer</code>.</p>

					</div>
					<div class="ui vertical segment">
						<h4>DirectContainer</h4>
						<p>See AccessPoint</p>
					</div>
					<div class="ui vertical segment">
						<h4>Execution</h4>
						<p>A resource that represents the execution of a Job and contains information about the job's execution such as the start time, end time, state of the job's execution, and,
							for certain types of jobs, where the results of the job execution are stored.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="ui vertical segment">
						<h4>ExportBackup</h4>
						<p>A type of Job that, when executed, will export the data of a Carbon application for backup purposes or for importing into another server. When an ExportBackup job is
							executed, it creates a zip archive file inside of which can be found a <code>*.trig</code> file that has all the application data (e.g. triples), and a folder containing
							all
							of the application's NonRDFSource resources such as images and files. The archive produced by an ExportBackup can be subsequently imported with an ImportBackup job.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="ui vertical segment">
						<h4>ImportBackup</h4>
						<p>A type of Job that, when executed, will replace a Carbon application's resources with the resources created by an ExportBackup job.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="ui vertical segment">
						<h4>ImportLDAPAgents</h4>
						<p>A type of Job that, when executed, creates LDAPAgents that contain properties that can be used as credentials for authentication. This Job can be configured so only
							certain user properties are copied from the LDAP server when the representative LDAPAgent is created.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="ui vertical segment">
						<h4>IndirectContainer</h4>
						<p>Though defined in the W3C Linked Data Platform 1.0 specification [LDP], IndirectContainers are not yet supported by Carbon.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="ui vertical segment">
						<h4>Job</h4>
						<p>
							A Job is a resource that defines one or more specialized tasks to be executed on the server. A Job may be scheduled or configured to run on demand. Each time the job runs,
							an Execution document is created with information about the job's execution.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="ui vertical segment">
						<h4>LDAPAgent</h4>
						<p>A special type of Agent that is created based on the information retrieved from an LDAP server when an ImportLDAPAgentsJob is executed.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="ui vertical segment">
						<h4>LDAPServer</h4>
						<p>An LDP RDFSource that contains the required configuration information to connect to an LDAP server.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="ui vertical segment">
						<h4>RDFRepresentation</h4>
						<p>An RDFRepresentation is an RDFSource that contains meta-data (properties) about a Non-RDFSource (a file or binary). When a file is uploaded into a Carbon app or
							otherwise created by Carbon, the RDFRepresentation is also created to describe and store various information about the file.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="ui vertical segment">
						<h4>RDFSource</h4>
						<p>
							A resource (basically, a <em>document</em> in Carbon) whose state is fully represented in RDF. An RDFSource is identified by a URI, which can be used
							with HTTP requests (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE). The content of an RDFSource document is an RDF graph - a set of RDF triples. The triples are the data properties of the
							resource, which can be either literal properties (string, date, number, etc.) or object properties (links to other resource URIs). All resources you create within a
							Carbon application, with the exception of ACLs, are RDFSource documents. That is to say, they are described by the <code>rdf:type</code> of
							<code>http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#RDFSource</code>, even if also described by additional types such as those that define the object classes of your application.
