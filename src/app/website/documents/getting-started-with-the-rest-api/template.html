							<p class="larger">This guide describes how to build an example application using the Carbon LDP REST API. The REST API provides a way for applications to interact with the
								Carbon platform
								using HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) and resources identified by URIs. The REST API is considered to be a lower-level API than the JavaScript SDK. Doing
								things directly with the
								REST API is generally more tedious than with the JavaScript SDK. However, understanding the REST API provides a lot of insight into how the platform works and can be
								advantageous for
								developers who seek to advance their understanding of the platform.</p>

					<section>
						<h2 class="ui header">About the example application</h2>

						<p>In this guide, we'll use the REST API to create a simple, but useful taxonomy service. A taxonomy is a controlled vocabulary of terms, organized in a hierarchy, that can be
							used for
							classifying and organizing information. Taxonomies are commonly used in web applications. Their terms are used for tagging content and as facets to help users filter and
							find. In this exercise,
							you'll learn some of the the most important functions of the REST API as well as fundamental Linked Data Platform concepts. You'll also have a useful application that you
							can use to create and
							manage a single 'canonical' source of terms such as a corporate enterprise taxonomy. Other applications will be able to consume and use the taxonomy service using the very
							same API.</p>

						<p>In this guide, we'll use the following steps to complete the application:</p>

						<ol>
							<li>Create an account on carbonldp.com</li>
							<li>Create an application</li>
							<li>Model the application (vocabulary, resources, containers)</li>
							<li>Create application resources</li>
							<li>Secure the application</li>
						</ol>

						<p>
							Since this guide focuses on the REST API, you'll need a tool that can help you create and send HTTP requests. We recommend <a href="https://www.getpostman.com/">Postman</a>.
							It's a great tool,
							it's free, and it's the one we'll be featuring in this guide. But feel free to use the tool you're most comfortable with. <br> <br>

						<h2 class="ui header">Create an account on carbonldp.com</h2>

						<p>
							To interact with Carbon through the REST API, we'll need a Carbon user account. Even this can be done through the REST API, so let's start by issuing a POST to create a new
							account. The resource
							that comprises a Carbon account is known as an <em>Agent</em> - a <em>platform agent</em> to be precise. Later, you will learn about  <em>application agents</em>, which
							represent accounts
							specifically for users of the applications you build.

							<p>Before issuing this request, you may want to examine its parts. To get more information about each part in the request, click to expand an item of interest below.</p>

							<div class="ui styled fluid accordion">
								<div class="title">
									<i class="dropdown icon"></i> Content-Type
								</div>
								<div class="content">
									<p>Since the request method is POST, the Content-Type HTTP header tells the platform what kind of content to expect in the body of the request. We use turtle (Terse
										RDF Triple Language) in
										our documentation because it's brief and clean. Once you understand the turtle syntax, you'll find that it's very easy to read and write. In all, Carbon
										supports the following content types:</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Turtle: text/turtle</li>
										<li>JSON-LD: application/ld+json</li>
										<li>RDF XML: application/rdf+xml</li>
									</ul>
								</div>
								<div class="title">
									<i class="dropdown icon"></i> Prefer
								</div>
								<div class="content">
									<p>
										The <code>Prefer</code> header uses a link relation to specify the <em>interaction model</em> of the target resource, which is the resource we're posting to -
										the <code>/platform/agents/</code>
										container. By using this header, we're specifying the desired behavior of the resource. Because we're adding a member resource to the target container, we need
										it to behave like a container
										as opposed to an <code>RDFSource</code> or a  <code>NonRDFSource</code> . In all, Carbon supports the following interaction model values for the
										<code>Prefer</code> header:
									</p>
									<ul>
										<li><code>http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#Container; rel=interaction-model</code></li>
										<li><code>http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#RDFSource; rel=interaction-model</code></li>

								</div>
								<div class="title">
									<i class="dropdown icon"></i> Slug
								</div>
								<div class="content">
									<p>
										The <code>Slug</code> header is intended to give the server a hint as to how to mint a new URI for the resource being created. If a slug is not provided, Carbon
										will generate a random number
										for the URI of the agent. In this case, however, we're specifying a preference to use john-doe. Therefore, if it is available for use, the server will mint the
										following URI:
									</p>

									<p>
										<code>{{protocolAndHost}}/platform/agents/jane-doe/</code>
									</p>
								</div>
								<div class="title">
									<i class="dropdown icon"></i> Body

								<div class="content">

									<p>The body of the request is an RDF graph of triples written in Turtle, which we told the server we'd be using in the Content-Type header.</p>

									<p>Using Turtle's @prefix directive we declare short prefix names so that we don't have to repeat long URIs in the triples that follow.</p>

									<p>Following is a brief description of each of the required triples that come after the namespace declarations:</p>

														The subject specifies an empty value relative to the base URI. In turtle, URIs are written enclosed in '&lt;' and '&gt;' and may be absolute RDF

							<p>You can always verify a newly created resource by issuing a GET request to its URI, but it's important to keep in mind that the URI created for the Application only
								references the
								metadata resource for your application. When a new Application is created, Carbon also creates an access point at the following URI:</p>

							<p>
								<code>{{protocolAndHost}}/apps/&lt;app-slug&gt;/</code>
							</p>

							<p>So, in the case of our example, the application's access point or root URI would be:</p>

							<p>
								<code>{{protocolAndHost}}/apps/taxonomy-hub/</code>
							</p>

							<p>The difference between this URI and the URI of the Application metadata resource is the absence of the /platform segment after the host name.</p>

							<p>Issue the following request to examine the root container that Carbon created for you.</p>

							<p>
								<span class="ui blue horizontal label">GET</span> <code>{{protocolAndHost}}/apps/taxonomy-hub/</code>
							</p>

							<p>Notice this time that since we did not specify an Accept header of type <code>application/ld+json</code>, so the response we'll get back will be in the default Turtle
								syntax. While JSON-LD is often easiest to process with JavaScript, you will typically find Turtle to be a little more compact and easier to read.</p>

						<h2 class="ui header">Model the application</h2>

						<p>Now that you have an application root created, you can begin to create RDF documents in the application. Before you start posting arbitrary RDF documents, however, it's a
							good idea to
							design a general model for the application. Answering the following questions can help you determine what the model should be.</p>

						<ul>
							<li>What entities will the resources in our application represent?</li>
							<li>What data attributes (or triples) will they have?</li>
							<li>Are there existing RDF vocabularies we can leverage for those attributes?</li>
							<li>What kinds of relationships (links) will we make in our data or with data in other sources?</li>
							<li>How will we use container behavior to create, modify, and enumerate member documents?</li>
						</ul>

						<p>Answering these questions up-front will help provide a logical and structured way to build your application. One way to think about this is to think about the most common
							use cases for the
							data and the following six areas of consideration:</p>

						<ol>
							<li><strong>Classes/Entities</strong> - The taxonomy terms are the main item of interest or <em>entity</em> we'll be working with - the main resource we'll be managing in
								the Carbon app.
							</li>
							<li><strong>Class/Entity Properties</strong> - Taxonomy terms are pretty simple; they're just concepts or labels. Perhaps they can be expressed in multiple languages. We'll
								start simple and
								let the entities change as more is required.
							</li>
							<li><strong> <strong>Class/Entity</strong> Relationships
							</strong> - A taxonomy implies that these terms are organized in a hierarchy, so we'll probably need to think about how to use container behavior to support that structure.
							</li>
							<li><strong>Application Functionality</strong> - The data for our application, the taxonomy terms, will typically be metadata used to help describe the subject and nature
								of information in
								other systems, so we'll allow other apps to make REST requests to consume the service.
							</li>
							<li><strong>Security</strong> - We'll need varying degrees of access to the data in our app, so we'll need to come up with the appropriate roles for controlling access.
							</li>
							<li><strong>User Interface</strong> - It's also likely that we'll want a user interface that makes it easy for permitted individuals to visualize and manage the taxonomy.
								Such a UI will
								likely employ the use of a tree control.
							</li>
						</ol>

							<h3 class="ui header">Re-using an established linked data vocabulary called SKOS</h3>

							<p>It's always a best-practice to re-use established linked data vocabularies instead of (re-)inventing duplicates and as it turns out, there's already a good vocabulary
								that seems to fit
								the needs of our application. It's called SKOS (Simple Knowledge Organization System). According to the SKOS Primer, it &quot;provides a model for expressing the basic
								structure and content of
								concept schemes such as thesauri, classification schemes, subject heading lists, taxonomies, folksonomies, and other similar types of controlled vocabulary.&quot;
								Sounds right up our alley,
								doesn't it? When we investigate SKOS, we not only see that it will suit the needs of our app, but that it provides a lot of clues about how we should model
								everything.</p>
						</section>

						<section>
							<h3 class="ui header">Mini SKOS Simple Knowledge Organization System primer</h3>

							<p>
								<strong>skos:Concept</strong>
							</p>

							<p>
								SKOS introduces the class  <code>skos:Concept</code> , which allows implementors to assert that a given resource is a concept. This is done in two steps:
							</p>

							<ol>
								<li>by creating (or reusing) a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) to uniquely identify the concept.</li>
								<li>by asserting in RDF, using the property <code>rdf:type</code>, that the resource identified by this URI is of type <code>skos:Concept</code>.
								</li>
							</ol>

							<p>So, there you can see, we already have the class that can represent a taxonomy term. This means that when we create resources that represent taxonomy terms, we simply
								need to assert that
								it's an rdf:type skos:Concept. For example:</p>

							<p>
								<code>&lt;Carbon-document-URI&gt; a skos:Concept.</code>
							</p>

							<p>
								(Remember, ' <code>a</code> ' in turtle is shorthand for <code>rdf:type</code> ).
							</p>

							<p>
								<strong>skos:prefLabel</strong>
							</p>

							<p>A SKOS Concept can have a preferred lexical label, which will be useful in representing it in a user interface. We'll be able to define a label for a concept as shown
								below.</p>
							<pre highlight class="turtle">
								&#60;carbon-document-uri&#62;
									a skos:Concept;
									skos:prefLabel "animals".
							</pre>

							<p>We can also support locale-specific labels.</p>

							<pre highlight class="turtle">
								&#60;carbon-document-uri&#62;
									rdf:type skos:Concept;
									skos:prefLabel "animals"@en;
									skos:prefLabel "animaux"@fr.
							</pre>

							<p>There is also a skos:altLabel and a skos:hiddenLabel, which can be used in the future, but we'll keep it simple for now and just stick to the skos:prefLabel.</p>

							<p>
								<strong>skos:broader and skos:narrower (semantic relationships)</strong>
							</p>

							<p>The skos:broader and skos:narrower properties give us what we need to express hierarchical links between our concepts.</p>

							<p>
								To assert that one concept is broader in meaning (i.e. more general) than another, the  <code>skos:broader</code> property is used. The  <code>skos:narrower</code>
								property is used to assert
								the inverse, namely when one concept is narrower in meaning (i.e. more specific) than another. For example:
							</p>

							<pre highlight class="turtle">
								&#60;carbon-document-uri&#62;
									rdf:type skos:Concept;
									skos:prefLabel "animals"@en;
									skos:narrower ex:mammals.
							</pre>

							<p>
								In SKOS, there is also the notion of a  <code>skos:related</code> link, which is used to assert an associative relationship. But again, we can add such things in the
								future. For now, we'll just
								stick to the parent/child relationship afforded by <code>skos:broader</code> and <code>skos:narrower</code> .
							</p>

							<p>
								<strong>skos:inScheme</strong>
							</p>

							<p>
								The <code>skos:inScheme</code> property is another we'll in concept documents. This property will allow us to associate a concept to one or more taxonomies. In our app,
								taxonomies can be
								represented by the <code>skos:ConceptScheme</code> , which is described next.
							</p>

							<p>
								<strong>skos:ConceptScheme</strong>
							</p>

							<p>
								The <code>skos:ConceptScheme</code> class will represent a taxonomy that concepts belong to. We'll use two properties with this class: <code>dct:title</code> and <code>skos:hasTopConcept</code>
								.
							</p>

							<p>
								<strong>dct:title</strong>
							</p>

							<p>
								The <code>dct:title</code> property is actually from another popular vocabulary - the Terms vocabulary of the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative. We'll use it to add a
								title to the taxonomies we
								create.
							</p>

							<p>
								<strong>skos:hasTopConcept</strong>
							</p>

							<p>
								The <code>skos:hasTopConcept</code> property will provide an efficient access to the entry points of our broader/narrower concept hierarchies. This property will allow
								our app to link a
								concept scheme (a taxonomy in our case) to the concepts it contains. The top concepts will represent the root concepts in the taxonomies we create.
							</p>

							<p>Here's an example of what an instance of a ConceptScheme with four top concepts might look like:</p>

							<pre highlight class="turtle">
								&#60;carbon-document-uri&#62;
									rdf:type skos:ConceptScheme;
									dct:title "Content Topics";
									skos:hasTopConcept
										&#60;carbon-document-uri&#62;,
										&#60;carbon-document-uri&#62;,
										&#60;carbon-document-uri&#62;,
										&#60;carbon-document-uri&#62;.
							</pre>

							<p>We now have all that we need to for the classes and properties required for our app. Relationships (links) between some of these properties as well as between additional
								LDP properties
								will allow us to organize concepts in a hierarchy and within a taxonomy concept scheme.</p>

							<p>Before we move on, it's worth mentioning that prefixes we've used come from the following namespaces.</p>

							<p>
								<b>Namespaces used</b>
							</p>

							<pre highlight class="turtle">

							<h3 class="ui header">Consider the role of LDP containers</h3>

							<p>It may seem intuitive to model the container behavior for our application in such that each concept is a container to its narrower concepts. Or, in other words, so that
								narrower concepts
								are represented as membership triples on their broader concepts.</p>

							<p>Let's imagine the following simple taxonomy, for example:</p>

							<ul>
								<li>Topics (ConceptScheme)
									<ul>
										<li>Design (Top Concept 1)
											<ul>
												<li>Information Architecture (Concept 1.1)</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li>Technology (Concept 2)
											<ul>
												<li>HTML5 (Concept 2.1)</li>
												<li>JavaScript (Concept 2.2)</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p>The intuitive container behavior to model might be as follows:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>taxonomy-hub/topics/
									<ul>
										<li>design/
											<ul>
												<li>information-architecture/</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
										<li>technology/
											<ul>
												<li>html5/</li>
												<li>javascript/</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p>Though Carbon enforces no restriction on doing this, there are a few reasons why we might not want to.</p>

							<p>First, as the depth of your taxonomy increases, so too does the length of your concept URIs. We should keep in mind that the fully qualified URI for each concept will
								also include the
								host and the base URI to the app. In this model, just one level deeper from the top concept could produce the following URI:</p>

							<p>
								<code>{{protocolAndHost}}/platform/apps/taxonomy-hub/topics/development/javascript</code>
							</p>

							<p>You can see how the addition of just a few more levels could lengthen the URI significantly.</p>

							<p>Another possible problem is that it creates a tight coupling between the URI for each concept and the location of the concept in a hierarchy. When you move categories
								around, you'd have
								to revise the URIs for several other concepts to keep the implication in tact. Furthermore, if you ever wanted to share concepts between branches of a taxonomy, or
								across multiple taxonomies,
								the implication of the URI would only be logical in one of the cases.</p>

							<p>Finally, there is a more elegant approach for leveraging container behavior that can reduce the work required to manage the taxonomies.</p>

							<ul>
								<li>taxonomy-hub/schemes/
									<ul>
										<li>topics/
											<ul>
												<li>top-concepts/</li>
												<li>design/</li>
												<li>information-architecture/</li>
												<li>technology/</li>
												<li>html5/</li>
												<li>javascript/</li>
											</ul>
										</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
							</ul>
							<p>
								We've flattened things out a bit so that all concepts are direct children of the <code>topics/</code> container. We've also added a new container called top-concepts to
								help us identify and
								manage which, of all the concepts, are those that should be root concepts in the scheme. 
							</p>

							<p>As we work with this alternative approach, you'll begin to see why it's an improvement.</p>

						</section>

						<section>

							<h3 class="ui header">Create example Concept Scheme</h3>

							<p>
								Now that we have the <code>schemes/</code> container, we can create one or more Concept Scheme containers within it. Since this is an action that would likely be
								repeated by end-users, it would
								make sense to incorporate the capability into a user interface. For now, however, let's be clear on what is required for the underlying HTTP request.
							</p>

							<p>Take note of the following triple on the container:</p>

								<code>&lt;&gt; ldp:memberOfRelation skos:inScheme</code>
							</p>

							<p>This configures the container to automatically add a link in each member that is added to the container. Whenever we POST a new concept into this scheme, Carbon will
								automatically add the
								following triple to the concept document:</p>

							<p>
								<code>&lt;concept-uri&gt; skos:inScheme &lt;{{protocolAndHost}}/apps/taxonomy-hub/schemes/&gt;</code>
							</p>

							<p>Create and issue the request. A successful request should result in HTT status 201 Created.</p>

							<p>This illustrates an interesting use of BasicContainer behavior. In the next step, we'll see another interesting use of container behavior with a DirectContainer.</p>
						</section>

						<section>

							<h3 class="ui header">Create the top-concepts/ Direct Container</h3>

							<p>
								As stated earlier, the <code>top-concepts/</code> container will give us an easy way to list the root concepts in a taxonomy. Our application should therefore create a
								<code>top-concepts/</code>
								container in every scheme created. You'd likely want to automate the creation of this container in the function that creates the scheme container, but for now, we'll
								do it by hand to complete the exercise. That is to say, for now, we're only supporting one concept scheme (taxonomy).
							</p>

							<p>This time, we'll make use of a Direct Container. A Direct Container creates an access point that helps you manage membership triples in another container.</p>

							<p>Create the following request.</p>

							<p>
								<span class="ui blue horizontal label">POST</span> <code>{{protocolAndHost}}/apps/taxonomy-hub/schemes/topics/</code>
							</p>

							<table class="ui celled table">

							</table>

							<p>
								<strong>Body (required)</strong>
							</p>

							<pre highlight class="turtle">
								@prefix ldp:&#60;http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#&#62;.
								@prefix skos:&#60;http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core#&#62;.

								&#60;&#62;
									a ldp:DirectContainer;
									ldp:membershipResource &#60;{{protocolAndHost}}/apps/taxonomy-hub/schemes/topics/&#62;;
									ldp:hasMemberRelation skos:hasTopConcept.
							</pre>

							<p>
								Notice, this time, we use the Prefer header to set the interaction model to RDF Source instead of Container. This keeps the <code>topics/</code> container that we're
								posting to from recognizing
								the <code>top-concepts/</code> container as a member. That is to say, it keeps it from recording a membership triple for the <code>top-concepts/</code> container. The
								outcome we want is for all
								concepts to be listed as members of the <code>topics/</code> container, but not the <code>top-concepts/</code> container.
							</p>

							<p>
								The  <code>ldp:membershipResource</code> predicate of this Direct Container specifies an entirely different resource where membership triples should be written.
								Whenever we post to this
								container (the <code>top-concepts/</code> container), a membership triple will be written to the specified resource, which is the <code>topics/</code> container. In
								other words, if we later put
								a Concept to the <code>top-concepts/</code> container, that concept will become a member of the <code>topics/</code> container. Why would we want to do this? To
								understand, we have to consider
								the  <code>ldp:hasMemberRelation</code> predicate, which is also used.
							</p>

							<p>
								Whenever the <code>top-concepts/</code> container writes a membership triple to the container specified by <code>ldp:membershipResource</code> , it will use the
								predicate <code>skos:hasTopConcept</code>
								to represent that membership relationship because of what's defined by <code>ldp:hasMemberRelation</code> . This feature exists so that we can use a different
								vocabulary other than the standard
								LDP vocabulary to represent membership relations. When we post to <code>top-concepts/</code> , for example, the following statement will be added to the
								<code>topics/</code> container:
							</p>

							<p>
								<code>&lt;{{protocolAndHost}}/apps/taxonomy-hub/schemes/topics/&gt; skos:hasTopConcept &lt;member-URI&gt;</code>
							</p>

							<p>
								We will not be posting to the <code>top-concepts/</code> container to create new documents. Instead, we'll post new concepts to the <code>topics/</code> container to
								create them and then later
								put the top concepts into the <code>top-concepts/</code> container. If you <em>post</em> a new resource to a container, the container creates a membership triple and a
								containment triple, but
								if you <em>put</em> an existing resource to a container, the container creates only a membership triple.
							</p>

							<p>Issue the request. A successful response should provide the HTTP status code 201 Created.</p>
						</section>

						<section>
							<h2 class="ui header">Create a root Concept</h2>

							<p>Now, we're ready to start creating concepts in our Topics taxonomy. This, of course, is a function that the GUI of our app would probably handle, but doing a few
								manually is important to
								this learning exercise.</p>

							<p>For our first Concept, create the following request.</p>

							<p>

								<span class="ui blue horizontal label">POST</span> <code>{{protocolAndHost}}/apps/taxonomy-hub/schemes/topics/</code>

									ldp:memberOfRelation skos:broader;
									skos:prefLabel "Design"@en;
									skos:prefLabel "DiseÃ±o"@es.
							</pre>

							<p>
								Notice, this time that the ldp:hasMemberRelation is skos:narrower. That means that any concept that is later PUT to this container will force a membership triple to be
								written on the container
								using  <code>skos:narrower</code> as the predicate.
							</p>

							<p>
								The <code>ldp:memberOfRelation</code> allows the inverse to be true. Any concept that is added to the membership of this container will get a triple written to it,
								which defines this concept as
								its <code>skos:broader</code> concept. When we add the Information Architecture concept as a member, for example, the <code>information-architecture/</code> resource
								will receive the following
								triple. 
							</p>

							<p>
								<code>&lt;...topics/design/information-architecture/&gt; skos:broader &lt;......topics/design/&gt;</code>
							</p>

							<p>As we can see now, features of a container support what's needed to use the SKOS vocabulary. From any concept, we have a way to look both downwards and upwards in the
								hierarchy.</p>

							<p>Issue the request. A successful response should provide the HTTP status code 201 Created.</p>
						</section>

						<section>

							<h2 class="ui header">Add root Concepts as member of the scheme</h2>

							<p>
								Now that the root concept is created, it is a member of its parent container. In other words, its parent container, <em>topics</em>, links to it with the following
								membership triple:
							</p>

							<p>
								<code>&lt;&gt; &lt;http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#member&gt; &lt;{{protocolAndHost}}/apps/taxonomy-hub/schemes/topics/design/&gt;</code>
							</p>

							<p>Since the parent container is a Basic Container, the concept is also contained by it. The parent container expresses this relationship with the following containment
								triple:</p>

							<p>
								<code>&lt;&gt; &lt;http://www.w3.org/ns/ldp#contains&gt; &lt;{{protocolAndHost}}/apps/taxonomy-hub/schemes/topics/design/&gt;</code>
							</p>

							<p>What's needed now is to identify the root concept as a member of the topics scheme with the skos:hasTopConcept relation. This will be done when we PUT the concept to the
								top-concepts
								container.</p>

							<li>Create application roles</li>
							<li>Create application users</li>

							</pre>

							<p>
								The ACL defines a <code>accessControlEntry</code> and an <code>inheritableEntry</code>, each linking to an <code>AccessControlEntry</code> by way of a blank nodes.
								The entry linked by <code>accessControlEntry</code> defines access to the resource itself. The entry linked by <code>inheritableEntry</code> defines permissions
								that can be inherited by child resources when the child resources do not override them.
							</p>


							<h4>Give the Editor role all permissions and the user role READ permissions.</h4>

							<p>The best way to modify permissions on a resource using the REST API is to start by getting the ACL for the resource as we've done here. We can then copy and
								paste that ACL into a text editor, make some manual modifications, and then update the ACL.</p>

							<p>For each role, repeat the following procedure.</p>

							<ul>
								<li>Copy an existing AccessControlEntry stanza and paste it at the bottom.
								<li>
								<li>Remove the <code>bNodeIdentifier</code> triple from the pasted stanza (Carbon will automatically generate a new one when we update the ACL).</li>
								<li>Change the name of the blank node so that it is unique in the file.</li>
								<li>Change the <code>security#subject</code> literal value to be the URI of the role that you are giving the permissions.</li>
								<li>Add the new blank nodes to the <code>security#accessControlEntry</code> and <code>security#inheritableEntry</code> triples near the top.</li>
							</ul>

							<p>When you are done, you should end up with something similar to what is shown in the body of the following request. To update the ACL, you then issue a <code>PUT</code>
								request to replace the ACL.</p>

						<h2 class="ui header">Conclusion</h2>

						<p>This guide described how to build an example application using the Carbon LDP REST API. Normally, developers will prefer use of the App DEV GUI and the JavaScript SDK,
							which together simplify the process of building an app. Still, all functions of the platform can be accessed via the REST API and those developers who understand it may
							find
							its use to be advantageous in some cases.</p>
