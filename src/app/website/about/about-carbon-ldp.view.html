				<h1>About Carbon LDP</h1>

				<!--
				<div class="ui message">
					<p class="larger">Carbon LDP is a Linked Data Platform for building web apps that manage and link data within your enterprise and across the World Wide Web.</p>
				</div>
				-->

				<p>Carbon is a server that responds to RESTful HTTP requests for reading and writing data. Acting as an
					authentication server, a database, and a security manager, it provides most of the server-side components
					developers need to build robust, data-centric web apps using pure client-side code. As such, it reduces
					the need to design, develop, deploy, and configure server-side components such as an application server,
					a database, and custom server-side code. Carbon makes it easier and faster for <em>every-day</em> web
					developers to build apps that process and manage data rather than just content.
				</p>

				<p>Like many popular NoSQL document-oriented databases, Carbon provides the ability to read and write
					<em>data documents</em> using simple JavaScript objects or JSON. Carbon data, however, is stored in a
					graph database, which is more advantageous than common document-oriented and traditional relational
					databases in a variety of cases. Since the data is stored natively in RDF (the Resource Description Framework),
					Carbon makes it easy to model any kind of resources without the need for rigid schemas. Need a new class,
					instance, property, or relationship? Simply add it on-the-fly. Forget about primary and foreign key
					relationships. Applications powered by Carbon are inherently <em>semantic</em> - capable of linking data
					with other applications and across the World Wide Web.</p>

				<p>Carbon LDP turns data graphs into documents so that working with data is like working with web pages - simple.
					Much like web pages, clients can retrieve a Carbon document by URL. However, most web pages are semi-structured and
					designed to be rendered in a web browser for human consumption. Carbon resources are represented by fully
					structured data. This makes them both easily transformed into HTML for rendering in a browser and more
					easily understood and processed by machines. This leads to a host of computational benefits and integration
					capabilities not afforded by typical application architectures. Applications powered by Carbon are ready
					for the next Web.</p>

				<p>What's more, Carbon provides fine-grained access to the data that exists within and across multiple documents.
					Each document acts as an end-point that can be queried using the powerful SPARQL semantic query language. To query
					across all data in a Carbon app, you can execute a query on the root document. Or, you can limit a query by
					executing it on any given point in a document hierarchy. SPARQL provides a full set of analytic query operations
					as well as a graph traversal syntax for graph-centric operations.</p>

				<p>Carbon LDP includes a Workbench - a graphical user interface that helps you visualize and manage data outside
					of your custom application. The Workbench provides a convenient way to create and list applications. It also
					features a Document Explorer for visualizing the documents, data, and links that exist in an application.
					It features a SPARQL Client so that you can compose queries and inspect data outside of your client-side
					application code. It also provides a utility for exporting and importing data backups. The Workbench itself
					is open-source. Developed as a Carbon app using Angular 2, it provides example code that developers can use
					as an example for how to build rich, single-page applications using popular front-end frameworks and Carbon LDP.</p>

				<p>We invite you to download and use the Carbon LDP public beta from this site (see: <a [routerLink]="[ '../get-started' ]">Get Started</a>). Please provide
				feedback and suggestions as you use the product. Premium support options available.
