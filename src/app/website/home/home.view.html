				<div class="five wide center aligned column feature">
					<h3 class="title">REST API</h3>
					<img class="ui centered small circular image" src="assets/images/ico-rest-150x150.gif">
					<p>Access and manage applications and data by URIs using RESTful requests over HTTP (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE). Work with documents in Turtle, RDF XML, or JSON-LD.
						Configure apps, schedule server-side jobs, execute queries - <em>everything</em> in Carbon is RESTful.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="five wide center aligned column feature">
					<h3 class="title">JavaScript / TypeScript SDK</h3>
					<img class="ui centered small circular image" src="assets/images/ico-javascript-150x150.gif">
					<p>The JavaScript Software Developer's Kit, available from the npm package manager, allows you to manage RDF data using familar JavaScript and
						TypeScript programming techniques and tools. Build for execution within a web browser or Node.js.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="five wide center aligned column feature">
					<h3 class="title">Security</h3>
					<img class="ui centered small circular image" src="assets/images/ico-security-150x150.gif">
					<p>Secure your application through authentication and role-based access control. You can apply inheritable access control on your application, on parent containers, and all the
						way down to the document level.</p>
				</div>
			</div>

			<div class="row">
				<div class="five wide center aligned column feature">
					<h3 class="title">Visual Tools</h3>
					<img class="ui centered small circular image" src="assets/images/ico-visual-150x150.gif">
					<p>Use time-saving tools in the Application Developer's Console, a GUI that helps you visualize and manage applications and data outside of code. Visualize your container
						hierarchy and click resources to inspect data.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="five wide center aligned column feature">
					<h3 class="title">RDF Native, NoSQL Graph Database</h3>
					<img class="ui centered small circular image" src="assets/images/ico-rdf-150x150.gif">
					<p>Data is represented and managed as documents, but stored natively as RDF triples in a NoSQL graph database. Break the shackles of rigid data schemas; add new entities
						and attributes on the fly. Link data with existing resources within your apps and across the web.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="five wide center aligned column feature">
					<h3 class="title">Query Data</h3>
					<img class="ui centered small circular image" src="assets/images/ico-query-150x150.gif">
					<p>Query for data across multiple documents using the SPARQL query language. Query-down for a broad view from any segment of an application or against individual documents.
						Query with the REST API, the JavaScript SDK, or the built-in visual SPARQL query editor.</p>
				</div>
