				<section>
					<h2 class="ui header">Register for the Beta and Community Support</h2>
					<p>First, before anything else, please consider registering for the beta and to join our community. Registered users receive important news and announcements such as when new
						software updates become available. Registered users also receive priority in the community support queue. What's more, registered users who provide valuable beta feedback
						(questions, suggestions, defects, and feature requests) are eligible for Valued Feedback Rewards, which we give generously.</p>
					<p>If you haven't already, why not <strong><a class="item" [routerLink]="[ '/get-started' ]">Get Started</a></strong> now?</p>
					<p>Not sure yet? There's no harm in trying. Our <a class="item" [routerLink]="[ '/license' ]">license</a> grants you perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, and
						royalty-free use.</p>

						<h3 class="ui header">Feedback, Questions, and Issues</h3>
						<p>We use GitHub to host our git repositories and to track project issues (e.g. bugs, features, questions, suggestions, tasks). To learn about the conventions we use and
							the workflow we follow for prioritizing and managing issues, please
							review <a href="https://github.com/CarbonLDP/carbonldp/wiki/GitHub-Conventions-and-Workflow-for-Carbon-LDP">GitHub Conventions and Workflow for Carbon LDP</a>. Then, we
							invite you to participate using our General Issues page:</p>

						<p><i class="big github icon"></i> <strong><a href="https://github.com/CarbonLDP/carbonldp/issues">Carbon LDP Issues on GitHub</a></strong></p>

						<p>Remember, registered users who provide valuable feedback are eligible for Valued Feedback Rewards. It's our way of incentivizing proactive feedback and just
							one little way we like to say, &quot;thanks&quot; to our users. Aside from improving the product, posting feedback
							(e.g. a good question, a defect, or an intriguing feature request) can win you gift cards for popular shopping destinations.
							We distribute rewards to registered users based first on derived value to the product and community, and then by random selection.</p>
